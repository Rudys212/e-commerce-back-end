# e-commerce-back-end

## **Description**  
-------------
This application is the back end for an e-commerce site. The application was made using Sequelize, MySQL, and Express.js. A user would be able to implement this for their e-commerce business. The client's users would be able to look up, edit and delete items from a site with the help of the back end server application.

 ## **How to Use**
 ---------------
- The user would start by cloning the repository to their local computer.

- The user would need to first install the dependencies for the application with the command ```npm i```.
  
-The user would need to complete a .env file with their password, username, and database name. The .env.EXAMPLE can be used to enter the correct information. This will protect the client's private information.

- Then the schema would be run with MySQL to start the database.

-The user would seed the database with the command: ```npm run seed```.

- The user would start the application by entering the command:  ```node server.js```. This would start the application at http://localhost:3001/ and the routes would be established to test user input.

- The routes can be tested with Insomnia to see how the established routes would respond with user input.
